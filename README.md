# Rock_Paper_Scissors


## My very first project :)

## Task:
Writing a rock-paper-scissors game. If you don't know how this 
game works you can read about the rules here: [Rock_Paper_Scissors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors)

How the game works:
- First, you have to choose between the given objects:
    - these are case-insensitive and
    - you can't give an invalid input
- Then, the computer chooses a random object too.
- The program prints who won, and also gives you a notice about the scores
- Finally, it asks you whether you want to play again
